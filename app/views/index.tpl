<h1>What is php.rum?</h1>

<p>PHPRum is an event driven object oriented HTML5/PHP5 web application framework that allows you to build
	web applications with as few lines of code as possible using concepts like Controllers, Views, Active records, Data binding, and Convention over Configuration.
Rum was designed conceptually from the ground up to mimic the architecture of a desktop application using events, and Web controls.</p>
